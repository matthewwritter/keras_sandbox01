      "[MEHOM] <p>for those who are too lz to click the link<p> <i><i><i><i><i>may 1 2007high court puts limits on patentsby linda greenhouse<p>washington april 30  the supreme court in its most important patent ruling in years on monday raised the bar for obtaining patents on new products that combine elements of pre-existing inventions<p>if the combination results from nothing more than ordinary innovation and does no more than yield predictable results the court said in a unanimous opinion it is not entitled to the exclusive rights that patent protection conveys were it otherwise justice anthony m kennedy wrote in the opinion patents might stifle rather than promote the progress of useful arts<p>because most inventions combine previously known elements the courts approach to deciding what sort of combination is so obvious as to be ineligible for patent protection will have widespread application the result will be to make patents harder to obtain and defend<p>granting patent protection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation retards progress justice kennedy said he added that such patents were also undesirable because they might deprive earlier innovations of their value or utility<p>patent law experts said the ruling created a common sense standard that could have a broad impact<p>nearly every patent that contains a combination of prior ideas is at risk because the court has dramatically broadened the standard of obviousness said cynthia kernick an intellectual property lawyer at reed smith in pittsburgh<p>judges will have more leeway to dismiss patent infringement lawsuits without requiring a jury trial and patent examiners who generally grant patent applications unless they find prior references to the same invention will now feel freer to deny claims said matthew kreeger an intellectual property lawyer at morrison and foerster in san francisco<p>and we could see thousands of cases asking the patent office to re-examine patents it has already granted said mr kreeger who was one of the lawyers who had prepared a brief filed by the biotechnology industry organization in support of the patent it doesnt take a lot of resources to ask for a re-examination to be eligible for a patent an invention must be novel useful and not obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field the supreme court case concerned a fairly typical dispute over whether a combination of old elements in a new way was new or simply obvious to any expert<p>at issue was an adjustable gas pedal for use on cars and trucks equipped with electronic engine controls how could the vehicles computer tell the pedals position? a canadian company ksr international under contract to general motors solved the problem by mounting an electronic sensor at the pedals fixed pivot point in order to communicate the necessary information<p>a rival teleflex inc demanded royalties claiming the device infringed its patent on an adjustable gas pedal equipped with an electronic sensor ksr refused to pay on the ground that teleflex had combined existing elements in an obvious manner and that its patent was therefore invalid ksr won in federal district court in detroit but that decision was overturned in 2005 by the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit<p>that court in washington has exclusive jurisdiction over patent appeals after years of permitting its judgments to stand unreviewed the supreme court has begun to take an active interest in the federal circuits cases and has overturned several including a second case the justices decided on monday in favor of microsoft in a dispute with at&t<p>in granting judgment for ksr on monday in ksr international co v teleflex inc no 04-1350 the supreme court listed several specific errors and fundamental misunderstandings in how the federal circuit had analyzed the case in looking at the teleflex patent justice kennedy said the appeals court made the mistake of considering what a pedal designer writing on a blank slate would have done to solve the problem of the pedal and the sensor but the slate was not blank he continued and the teleflex patent was essentially an upgrade of existing technology<p>justice kennedy said the problem was not necessarily the federal circuits overall approach but rather its rigid way of applying a commonly used legal test the test requires a person challenging a patent as obvious to identify a reason that would have prompted someone to combine two or more previous inventions such as published articles suggesting such a combination this has made it difficult to attack a patent as obvious and has often precluded summary judgment instead requiring an expensive jury trial<p>justice kennedy said that this test in the federal circuits hands had led to a constricted analysis that paid too much attention to an inventors motivation and too little to a simpler inquiry: whether there existed at the time of invention a known problem for which there was an obvious solution the teleflex patent fit that description he said<p>the federal government which had sided with ksr argued that the federal circuits approach had led to the granting of too many patents to obvious inventions pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry groups entering the case for teleflex argued that innovation would suffer if patents became too hard to defend<p>in a sense the case presented a moving target while the ksr appeal was pending the federal circuit issued several decisions reflecting openness to challenges to patents as unworthy because of obviousness those decisions of course are not before us now justice kennedy said<p>court sides with microsoft<p>washington april 30 ap  the supreme court sided with the microsoft corporation on monday finding that patent law does not apply to software sent to foreign countries<p>in a 7-1 decision the court rejected at&ts position that it was entitled to damages for every windows-based computer made outside the united states using technology that compresses speech into computer code<p>at&t had said computers running the windows operating system infringed on its technology for a digital speech coder system<p>the decision could affect other lawsuits against microsoft and save it billions because of the global scope of its operations<p>the supreme court said software should be treated like exported blueprints and schematics\n",

      "[nostrademons] i was gonna post a comment similar to this one on reddit but i didnt think itd be appreciated  i think ill manage to piss off both the austrian school misesorg libertarians and the i-always-get-screwed-by-corporations liberals<p>free markets work when they transmit information with each transaction  when a factory owner raises his prices to cover rising costs hes encapsulating information about <i>everything<i> thats happened further up the value chain  when a shopkeeper lowers the price hes willing to pay hes encapsulating information about consumer demand and everything downstream in the value chain  if a new means of production becomes available thats more efficient than the old one theres a profit opportunity available for the aspiring entrepreneur  and everybody has an incentive to pass on correct information because otherwise its their own bank account that will suffer  this appears to be the <i>only<i> way to organize an economy efficiently<p>free markets <i>fail<i> when transactions conceal information  for example many subprime loans were made to people who had no conceivable way of paying them off but mortgage brokers had every incentive to hide that information from the hedge funds who bought them and didnt have to shoulder the risk of default themselves  health-care patients have no way of knowing whether a particular procedure is medically necessary and no incentive to find out because the insurance company pays for it  microsoft customers had no way of knowing whether windows is the best os because there were no alternatives well except apple and linuxpretend this is 1997 or so<p>theres also the issue of transaction costs - it costs nearly as much money to collect tolls as it does to just build the damn highway so the information that the customer sees is heavily distorted by the process of having to collect that information<p>so based on this i can derive some general principles for the role of government:<p>1 it should provide the institutional framework necessary for the market to function at all eg contract laws and defense<p>2 it should rectify the lemon problem where sellers conceal vital information from buyers or vice-versa eg consumer protection laws implied warranties truth-in-advertising laws full disclosure on mortgages sec regulation etc<p>3 it should prevent companies from leveraging a monopoly to enter a market<p>4 it should rectify externalities where a firm takes something of value to others but doesnt pay for it usually because its too difficult to arrange a transaction  the classic example is pollution<p>5 it should provide goods and services where the transaction cost of attempting to measure and restrict usage is greater than the actual value of the service  markets will never develop in these areas otherwise  a good example would be roads<p>some concrete examples whichll probably seem kinda out-there:<p>to start i wouldnt have any taxes at all  instead the government owns all land and raises revenue by auctioning off leases on land natural resources and pollution credits  these leases would be tradable subdividable securities and would be subject to normal sec prohibitions on disclosure and insider trading  if you wanted to construct a skyscraper that you expect to last 50 years youd buy a 50-year lease on the land  if you ended up selling it after 20 you could sell the lease on the open market but the land itself would revert back to the government after another 30 years  the government can also buy the lease back by paying market rates<p>this helps the externality problem because every time the voters want to prevent something like a polluting factory they have the legal ability to but they also have a precise dollar figure for how much itll cost in economic terms  if people dont want oil companies to drill in the arctic national wildlife refuge they can simply block the lease on drilling rights but it will cost them a few billion dollars  then they can decide whether the economic value to oil companies is worth more than the government services they will receive from it<p>as for spending itself - roads are an obvious one because the transaction costs of tolls are hellish  defense is another one - i dont think we need to spend quite so much as we do but we do need a strong military<p>i would <i>not<i> provide free education other than the basic literacy and civic requirements necessary for democracy to function  you tend to get what you pay for  free education not only leads to bureacratic uncaring schoolboards but it also leads to freeriding uncaring schoolchildren  <p>instead id create rigorous public evaluations of all schools - not necessarily tests which generally reflect the politicians biases more than actually useful information but statistics about where graduates end up satisfaction levels evaluations from past students etc  then let people choose - and spend their own money - on schools  since people shouldnt be denied education based on what their parents do there should be loans available - but through the private sector not public  <p>also education has a problem in that it takes years for it to pay off and market conditions can change dramatically between when you enter and when you exit  to insure against this id create a tradable derivative called salary futures again through the private sector  this is not insurance on <i>your<i> salary that would have a huge moral hazard problem but rather a promise to pay the change in the difference between the average salaries of two professions  these can be bundled into funds if necessary to diversify across the whole economy  so if you want to become an engineer but find that salaries have gone way down by the time you graduate your salary future will kick in with the difference for x number of years and then you can decide whether to stick with it or retrain as a lawyer<p>health care is tricky because nobody wants to die and if life really is priceless then people should be willing to pay infinite amounts of money to avoid dying  markets arent meant to deal with infinities id need to think about this; i suppose if i actually came up with a workable solution id be rich and famous and wouldnt be posting it on a glorified message board ;-\n",
